## API Navigation

---

### Access to the artworks listing endpoint in our API by visiting the following URL:

```json
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
```

### Your response will look something like this:

```json
"data": [
{
"id": 262718,
"api_model": "artworks",
"api_link": "https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/262718",
"is_boosted": false,
"title": "Native Hosts for Chicago",
"alt_titles": null,
"thumbnail": {},
"main_reference_number": "2022.141a-c",
"has_not_been_viewed_much": true,
"boost_rank": null,
...
"image_id": "4fdd9b79-f8b9-af9b-4967-7fc1c3faefe6",
...
```

As you can see this API does not contain image files. Instead of this, you can
see image_id:

```json
...
"image_id": "4fdd9b79-f8b9-af9b-4967-7fc1c3faefe6",
...
```

### [API Documentation ](https://api.artic.edu/docs/). In section 'Images' you can see an example of how should be Image API

```json
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{identifier}/full/843,/0/default.jpg
```

# Example:

### Retrieve one or more artworks with image_id fields. Here are a few ways of doing

so:

```js
# La Grande Jatte
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/27992?fields=id,title,image_id
# La Grande Jatte and The Bedroom
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?ids=27992,28560&fields=id,title,image_id
# Top two public domain artworks
https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?query[term][is_public_domain]=true&limit=2&fields=id,title,image_id
```

### In my project I used:

```json
# https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/27992?fields=id,title,image_id
```

1. Let's go with the first one, La Grande Jatte (opens new window). Your
   response will look something like this:

```json

"data": {
"id": 27992,
"title": "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte â€” 1884",
"image_id": "2d484387-2509-5e8e-2c43-22f9981972eb"
},
"info": {
...
"config": {
"iiif_url": "https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2",
```

2. Find the base IIIF Image API endpoint in the config.iiif_url field:

```json
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2
```

3. Append the image_id of the artwork as a segment to this URL:

```json
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33
```

4. Append /full/843,/0/default.jpg to the URL:

```json
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33/full/843,/0/default.jpg
```
